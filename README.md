# Brute

A program that bruteforce SHA-2 hashed password.

example : `brute <SHA-2> input`

## SHA-2
Quote from a random website :
SHA-2 is a collection of hashing algorithms, each differentiated by the size of the output string (in bits). For example, there are SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 algorithms. The size of the output hash matters because the longer it is, the more secure it is. However, the longer the output, the more computational power it requires.

The SHA-2 algorithm collection was created and first published by the National Security Agency (NSA) in the US. It is one of the most widely used hashing algorithms, and in some places, legally required to be used for password protection and storage.
